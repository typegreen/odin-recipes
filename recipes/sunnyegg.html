        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Here's how to cook sunny side up eggs properly.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Olive or Canola Oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the nonstick pan/skillet over medium-low heat</li>
            <li>Gently crack eggs into the pan. If the eggs make a hissing sound or the whites bubble, turn down the heat.</li>
            <li>Cook for 3 minutes or until the whites are mostly set, with some still-runny whites near the yolks.</li>
            <li>Tilt the pan forward so that the remaining oil pools. Dip a spoon into the the oil and gently baste the uncooked patches of white until they're set. Don't baste the yolks.</li>
            <li>Add preferred seasoning</li>
            <li>Remove the eggs from the pan</li>
        </ol>
